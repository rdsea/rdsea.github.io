# Open Position for a Full time Doctoral Student, 2021

*The position will be open until filled.*

### Topic

Large-scale computing on modern architectures and systems: Programming models, Designs and Optimization.


### Description:

The topic will focus on researching and developing techniques and tools for large-scale computing on modern architectures and systems. We will investigate emerging programming models, such as function-as-a-service, hybrid workflows of traditional data analysis pipelines and machine learning pipelines, and human-in-the-loop in large-scale, complex analysis. Novel software techniques and methods will be developed for support the developer to design, manage and optimize large-scale computing and data analysis applications. **Observability, performance, elasticity, interpretability and explainability will be particular features in the focus of the design and optimization.**

Large-scale computing will be targeted to emerging solutions for large-scale and data-intensive applications, which combine traditional workflow-based large-scale data analysis with machine learning, whereas modern systems will be high-performance computing systems with CPU/GPU, large-scale edge-cloud containerized systems, systems with AI accelerators, and potentially quantum computing systems.

### What we offer

The position is a full-time employment, following the collective employment system of Aalto for PhD students. Currently, the starting salary of a first year Ph.D. student is ~2500 â‚¬/month (gross) with 1612 working hours per year. The salary will be increased by following the collective employment system. An initial contract will be 2 years and then another 2 years contract will be extended, after a successful performance evaluation. It is expected that the candidate will finish the PhD study within 4 years and contribute to the teaching and other research activities of [the AaltoSEA group](https://rdsea.github.io).

### Skills
 - Very good knowledge about systems-oriented research and engineering
 - Very good knowledge of large-scale computing systems
 - Very good in programming, especially with Python and Java/C.
 - Familiar with workflows and ML pipelines
 - Very good knowledge in tools for programs and systems monitoring and analysis (e.g., instrumentation, tracing, system monitoring)
